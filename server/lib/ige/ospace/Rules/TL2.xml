		<preresearch>A network of bases and spaceports that would allow effective repair of spacecrafts. It also serves as refuelling station for our ships.</preresearch>
		<description>Repair Facility is actually net of the smaller and larger landing pads and airstrips that cover all planet. This allows pilot to choose the station closest to him and be repaired quickly. These facilities usually contain tools necessary to fix the aircraft and few reserve pilots in case of some injury. While effective, repair of spacecrafts is a difficult thing and takes some time, despite the conditions and technology. Repair of larger crafts is fast too, but it is impossible to have some many spare parts ready and some must be manufactured on the spot.</description>
		<flavor>Empire in its arrogance aimed to win every battle with one decisive strike and hence allmost no repair bases were built. This weakness was soon exploited by rebel generals. Large ships that were able to withstand major beating were being continuously repaired and Imperial fleet was soon overcame with much more inferior fleet.</flavor>

		<preresearch>When morale starts to threaten your domain, it is time, to do something about it. Either fix the people or fix the reasons for given disorder. Entertainment center tries to do the latter.</preresearch>
		<description>Entertainment centers are, as the name suggests, places where colonists can find some pleasure and spent their leisure time. In more civilized parts of the universe, entertainment is more noble, like theaters, galleries and alike. It is the simple matter of demand and supply. These entertainment centers simply try to make people happy. Relieving them of their hardships, they are more likely to be content and less likely to revolt. Especially on border systems, where contact with the rest of the galaxy is rare and people are unlikely to organize anything for themselves, these structures are very important.</description>
		<flavor>One of the most popular computer games to be found in the entertainment centers across the Sheng sector was called Doom XI. An excellent virtual reality 3D shooter, this was the GAME. While the official version was perfectly harmless with any sustained 'damage' felt only as a added presure of VR suit, the enigma 1.3 patch changed this game into a death-risk reality. The pain was real(induced through neural receptors, the wounds were not) and when you died, the brain was intentionally overloaded and player died too. Illeagal tournaments, bets, random accidents, suicides, it all was extremly appealing to the bored population of Sheng systems and thus, the governor felt no need to do anything against it. Unfortunately, one enlightened hacker managed to insert enigma patch with die-or-win-only feature to his personal VR set. Governor made it to level 17...</flavor>
