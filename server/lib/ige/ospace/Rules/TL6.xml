		<preresearch>The Battle Tag technology worked by mobile probes dropping hyper-responders onto enemy ships, but the noise of battle make these sometimes hard to locate. Is there any way we can improve the clarity of the signal?</preresearch>
		<description>Deployed through a direct fire laser targeting system, the Psionic Beacon is the result of hundreds of hours of research across a multitude of planets. Becuase the tracking signal is now broadcast directly to the cyborg brains of the weapon controllers, the signal clarity has greatly improved. This integration also reduces response time, significantly increasing our to-hit chances.</description>
