        <description>Hyperspace instabilities are created by passing vessels. Utilizing a high-energy etymologizer, we can predict the movements of these variations in hyperspace (even before a ship creates them), which allows us to detect fleets at great range. As a side effect, the ability to predict where hyperspace instabilities occur allow us to also predict the movement of interspacial bubbles. These bubbles act as hyperdimensional accelerators that can propel our ships to low-level stargate velocities. This base also comes equipped with fueling shuttles that maintain our ships stationed in orbit.</description>

        <description>Equipped with the latest in nova-class warheads, the Supernova Mine Field does significantly more damage than the standard mine field. The control structure both deploys faster and can maintain more mines.</description>
        <flavor>Only one mine field control structure in the system will be used for deploying mines. Having two structures is effectively useless.</flavor>

        <preresearch>Bionics believe in the power of the environment. To us it stands in the way of getting at the deeply burried minerals.</preresearch>
        <description>Removing and processing the surface of the planet allows us to find significant deposits of minerals. It's only drawback is that, once depleated, there are no more minerals to be found on the planet's surface. As a side effect, this is the best way to cause Bionics havoc: we can now utterly wipe out their Gaia worlds!</description>
