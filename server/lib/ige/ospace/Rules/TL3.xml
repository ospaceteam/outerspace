		<preresearch>Technologies and projects to alter your surroundings on a planetary level.</preresearch>
		<description>Planetary engineering is only a theoretical science with no direct practical applications, but that does not make it any less useful. It is a theory of altering planets in several ways. Engineering projects contain ways to expand surface and make it usable for population. Ecology theories concern themselves with ecosystems. Either introducing and adapting standards to local planet or adjusting current system to be more useful for colonists. Third and possibly most important is the combination of both, terraforming. While now, it is perfectly understood, practical realization still has to be research. In theory, we know how to terraform any planet and convert it to earthlike planet. Desert, cold, hostile, it all can theoretically end in an earhtlike plant.</description>
		<flavor>There has been some general concern about planetry engineering technologies being put to general use. Those against this object that we might destroy something, we do not understand, that it would rob us of variety. That space full of earthlike planets would be like a giant megamarket (common department store type, usually orbiting slowly around planet. Buyers are teleported aboard and back with they shoppings right to their home). These arguments are surely nothing against benefits of terraforming.</flavor>

		<description>Habitable surface expansion is an extremly useful project, that will increase the capacity of the planet. On desert or rock-like planets, this project has only limited use, as the surface is already quite monotonous. The greatest effect is achieved on earthlike and marginal planets. Seas, tall mountains and such are all affected by surface expansion. Mountains are levelled, and ocean floor is made accesible by constructing large underwater domes. This project is very expansive and only very rich planet can afford this technology. Each project construction will increase planet's space by one.</description>
		<flavor>Suprisingly, there are no signs of surface expansion or strains of DNA from ecosystem initiation plantlife found on any planets in this region of space. We do not know for sure, wheteher empire had this technology on the same level as we do. It is certain from some old records, that empire had conducted a very similiar projects and research. Perhaps it was not on a such level, to allow a general use. It is a mystery, that we do not know.</flavor>
