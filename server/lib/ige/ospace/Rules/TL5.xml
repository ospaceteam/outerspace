		<preresearch>It has been discovered that the metal Wolframium can provide a vastly superior structure framework, giving a stronger building with a greater capacity.  We have found this should prove most useful for flak defenses.</preresearch>
		<description>With a bit of engineering ingenuity and wise application of Wolframium we have constructed a ground based defense structure worthy of both fear and awe.  Containing a full fifteen of our best weapons for targetting each ship size, this military installation houses a total of forty-five weapons at our disposal should anyone threaten our solar system.  As well the onboard scanner has been uprated and nearly matches the power of the Enh. Comm/scan Center.  It should be noted, however, that these are tactical scanners and thus are not able to be used to aid ship navigation as the dedicated scanning facilities are.</description>

		<description>With the newest facilities to meet the demands of the populous at large and the government comes the need to supply the needed power for these buildings to operate at acceptable levels.  Since the development of enhanced oil refinement and incindiary combustion, it has become clear that such advanced methods could simply not keep up.  Thus we have looked to a source of naturally occuring Plutonium deposits and found them to provide a significant output in a reactor.  Included in this design is also a considerable energy reservior to be used in the event of a plant shutdown.</description>

		<preresearch>Utilising the inherent structural properties of Wolframium, we are able to assemble a fortified complex capable of supplying our most basic needs in virtually any situation.</preresearch>
		<description>While our people are highly attuned to nature, sometimes there are problems that simply cannot be solved by even the most careful genetic authoring.  As such, we make use of a very rigid and extremely rare metal for this project.  Combining the attributes of solar collector energy production, and greenhouse farming techniques, we are able to consolidate these two processes into one seamless operation.  Excess production in both resources is used to feed a small bank of ground defenses including four anti-small, two anti-medium, and one anti-large weapon.  This symbol of efficiency provides the side benefit of keeping your citizens prideful in their advanced nation.</description>

		<preresearch>With the employment of Wolframium, our engineers can assemble a magnificent all-purpose fleet orbital facility.</preresearch>
		<description>This facility of titanic proportions is the ultimate expression of centralised fleet maintenance facilities ever conceived.  The massive Wolframium reinforced frame is tethered to the ground with sturdy cables, aiding space elevetors to ferry crewmen between the station and the planet's surface.  Housed within the massive frame is a stargate to expedite interplanetary travel, located on the top of the structure.  In addition, the facilities for refuelling, repair, and even ship upgrading are installed in huge service bays along side of the gate entrance.  No station can be complete without the capacity for automated defense in the event of attack, as such, there are six anti-small, four anti-medium, and two anti-large weapons of our best designs installed on an array near the cable tethers on the bottom, giving them a wide firing arc without the risk of damaging docked ships by friendly fire.</description>

		<description>Upon observing trial runs of the Spine Cannon and its successes in the field, the idea came across of, rather than destroying the ship, why not merely disable the crew onboard?  Previously abandoned bioengineering research had been reopened to develop what had once been a plaguesome creature; the virus.  Barely a lifeform, its function is simple, and thus was adapting the core architecture to this expanded role.  Existing cannons were easily retrofitted to store and launch a viral containment unit that had a piercing needle attached to the end, so that it may lodge into a ship's outer hull and inject the stored viruses into the host, where the infection then quickly spreads through the internal atmosphere and to the crew.  Some experimental anti-computer viruses are also included, but the success of these has been unreliable.</description>

		<description>Playing on the concepts brought about by the A-P Spore Torpedo and the Virus Injector, research teams have developed not only a purely organic missile, but also an organism capable of surviving tremendous g-force changes as well as having the natural defenses needed to deal with inanimate machines.  The missile itself is inert and will simply pierce the outer skin of its target.  The parasites stored within would then escape, attenuated to certain types of equipment, will seek out and discreetly sabotage such systems aboard the struck vessel, causing shipwide trouble and discord amongst the crew as they try to find the saboteurs.</description>

		<description>Our largest example of specially engineered lifeforms is represented in this weapons system.  A breeding stock of teethed worms is used to grow these creatures that are specially adapted for surviving the vacuum of space, and for consuming common spaceship materials.  The worm's skin is lined with small cilia which aid in locomotion in the launch tube.  The worm however has poor senses and thus can only detect large craft, but once it does there is nothing to stop it from latching on to the hull and taking a healthy bite out the target.</description>

		<description>Using the same overall organs of the once experimental Lichen Spreader, the Bile Launcher operates without the need of base lichens for the ordnance.  Instead, internal ship waste is carried over to the bile system and chemically broken down and reassembled into a thick enzymatic compound capable of digesting almost anything.  As a result the final compound needs to be stored in a crop designed to secret a special coating that is inert to the stored liquid.  Using rapid muscular contraction around the crop, the bile is shunted into an esophagus where peristalsis accelerates the fluid to ideal firing velocity.</description>

And as such we have a new symbiote, this time designed to consume any shipboard waste products, breaking down hazardous chemicals and chemically rebuilding them with internal gastric juices to create a highly corrosive slurry which the creature stores in a pressurized crop and can, upon command, launch the entire contents in a surprisingly accurate stream towards any sufficiently large target, thus dissolving much of the contact surface.</description>

		<preresearch>Our cannon technology can now move up to firing beams of collimated matter.</preresearch>
		<description>The Particle Beam Cannon, a loose extension of Maser/Laser technology, fires a beam of high energy accelerated plasma at six to ten kilometers per second, providing a devastating bolt of energy.  Waste plasma from a fusion reactor is first drawn into a small accumulator ring, which magnetically compresses and stores it.  When the cannon is fired, enough plasma to form a bolt is drawn into a larger ring which accelerates it to firing velocity and compresses it further, then feeds it a collimator after which it is discharged at the target.  To maximize hit chances against maneuverable targets, the cannon has an extremely fast refire rate, dividing the charge into four bolts fired in as many seconds before needing to recharge.  By this time the ship using it is usually out of position. Landing two or more of the four bolts can be crippling.</description>

		<preresearch>More powerful plasma bolter through charge driver technology.</preresearch>
		<description>The same science team responsible for the original Plasma Bolter has proposed an improvement to the system by incorporating charge driver technology, terming the new cannon system Charge-Accelerated.  By firing a charge into the plasma bolt just as it leaves the firing chamber, the bolt itself generates a FTL field which accelerates it along its current velocity vector.  The field is only capable of very small sublight acceleration due to the instabilities in the plasma and the limited charge, but the increase in kinetic energy, accuracy and the extra damage from the charge itself make the weapon system more effective, without significantly increasing weight or power requirements.</description>

		<description>It was a sad day when news spread about the untimely death of the famed Charge Driver's designer.  The causes were reported to be natural in origin.  Colleagues held a private ceremony in his honour, and upon going through the deceased scientist's personal effects, they found a portable data cache with some personal notes.  These appeared to be other experiments, as well as comments on the Charge Driver delivery system.  It seems what he demonstrated was only the beginning of a weapon of mighty grandeur.  Immediately the research team set about analyzing the data and testing the theories within, eventually constructing a notably superior Charge Driver.</description>

		<description>Similar to the Laser Pod in design and concept, this system packs far more punch per beam, providing devastating fighter defense, and a total firepower that even medium sized ships will turn their heads at.  The increased power has required a dedicated cooling system built into the pod itself, circulating coolant to its own heat sink on the back.  Although this is a design weakness that the Laser Pod did not have, most ships armed with multiple pods can use the arcs to ensure that nothing ever gets to the right angle to exploit it.</description>

		<preresearch>A massive high density continuous beam, beyond the power of ions.</preresearch>
		<description>This weapon is similar to the recently proposed particle beam technology, but it forgoes collimation in favor of continuous fire.  Gathering plasma into a set of eight large accumulator rings and highly compressing it, firing causes each ring to empty into the primary weapon ring in turn.  This accelerates the stream to twenty kilometers per second and sends it through the magnetic barrel.  As the rings deplete, the next takes over while the previous recharges, providing the capacity for an endless beam barring cooling requirements.  One must only concentrate this beam on the desired target, and watch it melt into scrap metal.  Like its predecessor, however, it is incapable of accurately tracking small ships.</description>

		<preresearch>To the winner go the spoils.  And to the realm of the unknown go the daring.</preresearch>
		<description>You can only improve upon yourself so many times, is the mantra amid the research communities.  When it came time to commission a new howitzer system, there was surprisingly little enthusiasm.  Those who stepped up to the challenge were met with many pitfalls and obstacles that just seemed impervious to solution.  It wasn't until the idea of hearkening back to an older era was presented, that anyone even hoped to achieve this monstrous task.  Initially built from 'spare parts', the first system seemed no different than a particle beam package.  Yet the difference lies in the accelerator coils as well as the base particles.  Rather than ions or raw elemental atoms, the source material is comprised of simple singular neutrons.  The acceleration systems are a most unusual configuration.  Very powerful, they provide a tremendous thrust for the neutrons, focusing them into a beam barely wider than the particle itself, and computer simulations have shown the potential for FTL acceleration under certain conditions.  This has not yet been given a live field test - nobody is quite that brave.  It could slice a target like it was tender flesh, or could cause nuclear fission of the target's matter itself, or it could even backfire and rip open a pandimensional vortex at the heart of the ship firing it.  Who knows?</description>

		<preresearch>When simple annihilation is insufficient, one must use infiltration.</preresearch>
		<description>A crowning achievement!  Herein is the most sophisticated small-scale warfare equipment ever devised.  This cannon design incorporated a tandem architecture; The first and primary role is a low power emissions system, generating a simple and harmless carrier wave in a straight path much the way a conventional laser would function.  This carrier wave transports a population of nanotechnology robots preprogrammed with heuristic interfacing software.  The purpose of this is to obtain control of the spacecraft or, failing that, cause internal damage by destabilizing critical systems such as the onboard powerplant or any hazardous weapons systems.  During development the immediate problem was brought to light: Energy shielding would completely block such a weak beam.  As well a thick hull skin would delay infiltration before any worthwhile result was achieved.  The second half of the Nanoblaster system is where these oversights are corrected.  The second emitter is a collimation of various EM and gravitational interference technologies to produce a cutting beam capable of piercing a hole in physical armour as well as weakening a local energy shield enough for the nanites to pass through.  Either way, a blow from this weapon can be most devastating to a fighter ship.</description>

		<preresearch>It is time we unveil our long awaited torpedo experiment.</preresearch>
		<description>Previously, we had pioneered the howitzer-class of weapons as an offense against larger ships while offering the flexibility of potential installation on any military craft.  While such was in development there was a sister project, closer adhering to the old torpedo standards.  However, rather than an archaic and hastily guided explosive package, this design consists of a large network of electromagnetic generators and field amplifiers phased in an array connected to a projection dish.  The resulting burst will arc across space, delivering a lethal blow to the targeted ship.  The arc is continuous, thereby allowing for direct charging and not risking loss of potential through travel time from firing to target impact.</description>

		<description>This new version of the Graviton Beam is the final word in beam weaponry.  The muzzle focus has been redesigned to work with higher grade scanning equipment, focusing the beam at a single point on the targets hull, rather than just turning the beam towards it.  Depending on combat conditions, it is also capable of narrow lines of fire, or even spreading the beam across the entire target, matching the shape without wasting any energy.  The beam source itself is more powerful as well, making for an extremely deadly weapon.</description>
		<flavor>A few asteroid miners were nearby when this weapon was tested.  They reported the formation of an event horizon for a few seconds during the test.  This was refuted by the science team in charge, who stated that the reflected light from and starlight behind the already dim asteroid was simply diffused to the point where it was not detectable without specialized equipment.</flavor>

		<preresearch>A theory is brought forth for your consideration.  Is it worth your time to investigate?</preresearch>
		<description>Here we have an example of antiquated concepts enhanced with present-day technological advances.  Taking use of the radioactive and volatile nature of a recently discovered vein of plutonium, our own history shows us an obvious use in the way of nuclear reactions in order to bring about massive destruction from a single warhead.  But rather than planetary bombardment, the idea was brought forth to apply this to bothersome fighter craft which may sometimes evade even our most skilled pod and turret gunners.  The weapon itself is massive to the extreme, as the warhead must be assembled shortly before firing.  The amount of plutonium used in the warhead would cause an autonomous chain reaction if the warheads were pre-made and in storage and would undoubtly scuttle the very ship carrying them.  The manufacturing on demand also provides a very slow refire rate for this weapons.  Once assembled, the mortar charge is carefully loaded into the firing mechanism.  Little is invested on targetting subsystems as the resultant blast is sufficient to engulf multiple spacecraft simultaneously, destroying them.  Those that do somehow survive would surely have endured severe damage.</description>

		<preresearch>A recently discovered, biologically toxic metal just may be of use to us.</preresearch>
		<description>Throughout our journey into living equipment, we have sloughed off the need for mundane metallurgy for solving our society's problems.  Even so, we can still find such materials beneficial to our cause.  In this case we have found a method of using a radioactive substance to complement our spaceborne navy.  Originally the concept was to use flakes of plutonium metal in a single missile, and use that to incite a radiation fallout inside the target vessel.  Testing with this design has failed to yield adequate results, so instead we looked back to simpler times amid histortical archives and found mentions of nuclear warfare.  This intrigued our current research team and quickly they gathered data on the substance at hand.  It was a short time before they managed to create a missile magazine.  Each individual missile is minute in comparison to our standard ship-to-ship missiles.  Even so, the firing magazine acts as a single targetting system for the set of eight missiles, guiding them all to a single target.  The missiles are designed to lodge into the target ship's hull, evenly spaced across the physical geometry, and to detonate in synchronised unison, devastating the entire outer hull of the ship.  Some tests have shown that a medium sized ship can be completely destroyed in short time this way.  However, they will have to deal with any energy shielding found.  This is a flaw we were not able to overcome.</description>

		<preresearch>Some creative thinking can exploit Plutonium into providing some strange and wondrous effects useful on starships.</preresearch>
		<description>Brought to you by a mysterious entity amongst the scientific community, this innocuous looking ship module provides numerous effects that encompass the entire ship it is installed upon.  Being powered by a pile of Plutonium dust, this black box amplifies the combat computers onboard the ship significantly, giving a very high increase to attack and defensive computations, including electronic countermeasures against guided weaponry.  Additionally, by accessing the ship's power grid at key points, in parallel to the central control systems, this module can virutally eliminate all scanner signature emitted by the craft under normal circumstances.  Lastly, the strangest effect of all (which the creators absolutely refuse to discuss the workings of), is that not only does the module have no mass of its own, but it actually reduces the ship's mass a slight degree.  A very strange invention indeed, and due to its highly complex nature, only one may be installed on any ship.</description>

Our top zoological engineers have managed to coax a strain of DNA extrapolated from relatively unimpressive ants into an immobile symbiant that actually is capable of feeding off Plutonium's alpha radiation, employing the particles into reinforcing its sturdy exoskeleton, which serves as the housing for the commanding officers of the ship.  Not only that, but the cerebral functions of the creature are remarkable, adding a valuable increase in combat accuracy and evasiveness.

		<preresearch>Large-scale propulsion with its own built-in thermonuclear powerplant.  A welcome addition to any menacing warcruiser.</preresearch>
		<description>Three issues have been observed with advancing ship design.  Increased mass, decreased effective range, and increased cost of assembly.  Dug up from some newly opened mines far off near the Galactic Core, a solution has been provided.  Using the inherently radioactive nature of Plutonium, a reactor has been created to harness this power, and directly integrated to massive FTL thruster assembly, enough to replace four standard FTL engines with a single one of these units.  The direct-power feed has resulted in greater thrust in addition to a larger power reserve.  With this, even our most massive battleships shall have greater range for persuit and conquest available to them.</description>
